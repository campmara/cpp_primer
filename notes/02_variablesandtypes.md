# Variables and Basic Types

Types specify what certain groups of data mean and what operations we can perform on that data.

There are primitive types (characters, integers, floating point numbers, etc.), library-defined types, as well as user-defined types. This chapter will cover the built-in types and shows how C++ can support more complicated types.

## Primitive Types

The built-in types in C++ include arithmetic types as well as the `void` type. `void` has no value and no meaning, and you'll see it used as a return type in functions that don't need to return things, as well as with void pointers.

There are two categories of arithmetic types: *integral types* (including character and boolean types), and *floating-point* types.
